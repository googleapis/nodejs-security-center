[Cloud Security Command Center](https://cloud.google.com/security-center/docs/) helps security teams gather data, identify threats, and act on them before they result in business damage or loss. It offers deep insight into application and data risk so that you can quickly mitigate threats to your cloud resources and evaluate overall health. With Cloud Security Command Center, you can view and monitor an inventory of your cloud assets, scan storage systems for sensitive data, detect common web vulnerabilities, and review access rights to your critical resources, all from a single, centralized dashboard.

## Using the client library

1.  [Select or create a Cloud Platform project][projects].

1.  [Enable billing for your project][billing].

1.  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth] so you can access the
    API from your local workstation.

1. Install the client library:

        npm install --save @google-cloud/security-center

1. Try an example:

```javascript
async function quickstart(
  organization = 'YOUR_ORGANIZATION', // Your GCP organization
) {
  const sc = require('@google-cloud/security-center');

  // Create a client
  const client = new sc.SecurityCenterClient();

  const formattedParent = client.organizationPath(organization);
  const reqSource = {};
  const request = {
    parent: formattedParent,
    source: reqSource,
  };

  const [source] = await client.createSource(request);
  // The newly created source.
  console.log('Source created.');
  console.log(source);
}
```


The [Cloud Security Command Center Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation
also contains samples.
